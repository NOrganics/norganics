      National Organics has maintained its position as the premier supplier of
      100% organic certified products in Nepal since 2010. We manufacture our
      products using novel processing techniques and the most advanced
      equipment. We are a company that is creative, unique, and loyal. We offer
      Nepalâ€™s most effective, unadulterated, and organic products. We prioritize
      quality. We are the first organization in Nepal to receive the Ecocert
      certification. Additionally, we adhere to all international environmental
      regulations. In order to produce high-quality organic products and serve
      without compromising responsibility, it is possible to pursue such
      certification. Aside from organic soapberries and essential oils, we offer
      Arabica coffee beans, spices and seasoning, as well as herbs and
      botanicals. The efficacy and purity of these products have made them
      highly sought after by international customers.
